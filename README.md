🕶️ FogSafe: AI-Powered Smart Glasses for Foggy Driving Conditions
FogSafe is a safety-focused innovation designed to reduce car accidents in foggy environments. It uses smart glasses integrated with AI, Arduino, infrared rays, and ultrasonic sensors to deliver a real-time visual feed to the driver—bypassing poor visibility conditions and providing safer driving assistance.

🌫️ Project Overview
Driving in heavy fog can lead to critical visibility issues, which are a major cause of road accidents. FogSafe tackles this problem by equipping the driver with smart glasses that display a live video feed enhanced by infrared sensing and AI object detection. The system helps the driver detect nearby obstacles or vehicles, even in zero-visibility conditions.

🔧 Key Features
🧠 AI-powered object detection for identifying cars, pedestrians, or obstacles

👓 Smart glasses provide a live visual feed directly to the driver’s eyes

🌫️ Infrared vision penetrates fog and low-light environments

📡 Ultrasonic sensors detect nearby obstacles and warn the driver

⚠️ Real-time alerts for potential collisions

🔋 Battery-powered, portable, and lightweight

🧰 Components & Technologies Used
Arduino Uno / Nano

Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)

IR Camera Module (or Night Vision Camera)

Micro display or Smart Glasses module (like OLED + lens or WiFi glasses)

Raspberry Pi or Edge AI board (for running AI models)

Buzzer or vibration motor (for warnings)

Rechargeable Battery

Wires, mounts, and 3D-printed glasses frame

🛠️ How It Works
Detection & Imaging: IR camera captures visuals even in dense fog; ultrasonic sensor detects obstacles up to a few meters.

AI Processing: Object detection AI model runs on Raspberry Pi or an edge processor to identify obstacles or vehicles.

Display Feed: A real-time video (optionally overlaid with bounding boxes) is shown on the smart glasses.

Feedback & Alerts: If something is too close, a buzzer or vibration motor alerts the driver instantly.
🚧 Project Status: In Development
FogSafe is currently an active, ongoing project. Our team is in the process of refining the hardware design, optimizing AI performance, and improving the real-time display system. Testing and iteration are ongoing to ensure safety, accuracy, and usability in real-world foggy driving conditions.
